    "I use Hugo for my site. I use Jupyter Notebooks to quickly prototype ideas or troubleshoot code. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a way to tell Hugo to take my Jupyter Notebooks and render them as static HTML pages on my site?\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The script then placed the converted markdown into `post/2018-04-30-hugo-jupyter.md`. Since I used the `--embed` flag, the markdown was placed in the output file, replacing any exisiting contents (instead of appending to the end). Since I used the `--force` flag, no error was raised if a file with the name already existed. Providing a `--section NAME` flag will place the output in another section besides the default `post`.\n",
