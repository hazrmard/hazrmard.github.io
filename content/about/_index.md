Hi. My name is Ibrahim. I am a PhD student at Vanderbilt university with a concentration in Electrical Engineering (EE). I also have a double major in EE and physics.

I am interested in electronics, computer vision, machine learning, web & mobile development, and astrophysics.

Currently I am doing research with [reinforcement learning for fault-tolerant control systems][1]. My undergratuate research was in [astrophysics on dark matter simulations][2]. I also did research on  radiation hardening experiments for electronics in space.

I like to run, and play tennis, football, and video games. I read fiction, cook (_because no meal plan for grad students :(_)  and work on personal [projects](/project/).

Here's a video I made on my current research. The video was for my fellowship with the Vanderbilt Institute of Digital Learning where I explored new ways of teaching using digital media.
