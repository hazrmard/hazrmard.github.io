+++

Hi. My name is Ibrahim. I am a PhD student at Vanderbilt university with a concentration in Electrical Engineering (EE). I also have a double major in EE and physics.

I am interested in electronics, computer vision, machine learning, web & mobile development, and astrophysics.

## Research

Currently I am researching [reinforcement learning for fault-tolerant control systems in smart buildings][1] and [unmanned aerial vehicles][5]. My undergratuate research was in [astrophysics on dark matter simulations][2]. I also did research on radiation hardening experiments for electronics in space.

I am part of the [Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems(MACS)][3] group at Vanderbilt University's [Institute for Software Integrated Systems][4].

## Out of the lab

I like to run, and play tennis, football, and video games. I read fiction, love to cook,  and work on personal [projects](/project/).
