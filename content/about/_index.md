+++

Hi. My name is Ibrahim. I am a PhD student at Vanderbilt University with a
concentration in Electrical Engineering (EE). I also have a double major in EE and
physics.

I am interested in electronics, computer vision, machine learning, web & mobile
development, and astrophysics.

Currently my [research is in Artificial Intelligence][1]. My undergratuate research was
in [astrophysics concerning dark matter simulations][2]. I also did research concerning 
radiation hardening experiments for electronics in space.

I like to run, and play tennis, football and video games. I read
fiction, cook (_because no meal plan for grad students :(_), and work on personal
[projects](/project/).

Here's a video I made regarding my current research. The video was for my
fellowship with the Vanderbilt Institute of Digital Learning where I'm
exploring new ways of teaching using digital media.
