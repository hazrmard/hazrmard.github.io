Hi. My name is Ibrahim. I built this website as a teaching aid for myself. I like to sprinkle updates here occasionally.

I am pursuing a career focused on machine learning and controls. See my [resume](/resume) for more details. My current projects involve data center design, energy optimization, generative AI for analytics, and HVAC controls.

I have a hobbyist's interest in electronics, web-development, and technical writing for a broad audience.

I have a professional interest in machine learning, reinforcement learning, optimization, and all manners of quantitative pursuits.

## Research

My PhD thesis was on *Adaptive Fault-tolerant Control Using Reinforcement Learning*. [You can read it here][7]. I investigated how to make data-driven control methods more efficient in resource constrained situations where fast adaptation was needed. Specifically, I researched [reinforcement learning for fault-tolerant control in unmanned aerial vehicles][6]. I also dabbled in machine learning for control of [smart buildings][1]. I was part of the [Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems(MACS)][3] group at Vanderbilt University's [Institute for Software Integrated Systems][4].

At a couple of internships, I worked with privacy-preserving machine learning, and with digital signal processing for machine learning-based prognostics.

In my undergraduate career, I worked in [astrophysics, on dark matter simulations][2]. I also did some research on radiation hardening experiments for electronics in space.

Here's a video I made on my previous research project. The video was for my fellowship with the Vanderbilt Institute of Digital Learning where I explored new ways of teaching using digital media.

## What I do for fun

I like running, bouldering, playing tennis, and the occasional video game. My favorite genres are sci-fi and epic fantasy. I love to cook. I approach potlucks extremely competitively :)
