+++

Hi. My name is Ibrahim. I'm on the fun side of my PhD defense, and the not-so-fun side of a job search. I went to Vanderbilt University for my PhD and undergraduate studies.

I have a hobbyist's interest in electronics, web-development, and writing for lay audience.

I have a professional interest in electrical engineering, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and all manners of quantitative pursuits.

## Research

My doctoral research was on [reinforcement learning for fault-tolerant control in unmanned aerial vehicles][6]. I also dabbled in machine learning for control of [smart buildings][1]. I did some undergratuate research in [astrophysics, on dark matter simulations][2]. I also did some research on radiation hardening experiments for electronics in space.

I was part of the [Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems(MACS)][3] group at Vanderbilt University's [Institute for Software Integrated Systems][4].

Here's a video I made on my previous research project. The video was for my fellowship with the Vanderbilt Institute of Digital Learning where I explored new ways of teaching using digital media.

## Out of the lab

I like running, bouldering, playing tennis, and the occasional video game. My favorite genres are sci-fi and epic fantasy. I love to cook. I approach potlucks extremely competitively :)
