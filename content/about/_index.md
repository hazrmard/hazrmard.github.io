Hi. My name is Ibrahim. I am a Masters/PhD student at Vanderbilt University with a
concentration in Electrical Engineering (EE). I also have a double major in EE and
physics.

I am interested in electronics, computer vision, machine learning, web & mobile
development, and astrophysics.

Currently my research is on adaptive fault tolerant systems using reinforcement
learning. My undergratuate research was in astrophysics concerning dark matter
simulations, and in electronics concerning the design of test interfaces for
radiation hardening experiments.

I like to run, and play tennis, football and video games. I read
fiction, cook (_because no meal plan for grad students :(_), and work on personal
[projects](/project/).
