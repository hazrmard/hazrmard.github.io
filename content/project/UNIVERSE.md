_UNIVERSE_ is an Agent Based Model of population dynamics of alien space-faring
civilizations in the galaxy. It simulates how civilizations may interact with
each other given limited resources. I developed this for my Modeling and
Simulation course with my partner Michael Schoenfield. The model considers
resources, technology, trade, and war when deciding on behavior of each
civilization.
