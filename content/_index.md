Hi. I am a PhD candidate at Vanderbilt University. My research involves transfer and reinforcement learning for autonomous control. I apply my work to unmanned aerial vehicles and smart buildings.

I like working on personal projects to learn new technologies. I have an interest in web development, embedded systems, and data science.

When not in front of my workstation, I am playing tennis, cooking, reading, or hiking with friends.
