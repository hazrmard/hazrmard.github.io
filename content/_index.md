I am a PhD candidate at Vanderbilt University, graduating in early spring '23. My research involves reinforcement learning for fault-tolerant control. I apply my work to unmanned aerial vehicles and smart buildings.

I am open to work opportunities. Please take a look at my [résumé](/resume) and [research overview](/about/my_research).
