      <description>As of the writing of this post, I maintain this site using my very own theme created in hugo. Hugo is a static site generator. It takes a bunch of plain text, applies a theme, and renders it as HTML. This is opposed to applications like Wordpress that assemble a page each time its served, to put it simply. This compute once, use many times approach saves on processing time and makes a site more portable.</description>

      <description>According to httparchive the average size of a web page in 2016 was around 2.5MB. Now this may not seem a lot in this age where the internet is the primary media delivery platform - but it is worth noting that most web pages serve text as their primary content. Looking at the report sheds light on what constitutes an average web page:
The HTML content takes up around 50-60kB. Images, understandably, make up the biggest chunk with ~1.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last weekend, I was looking to brush up my web-dev skills (what little I had learned on the side). I decided to make a simple web app for my residents to use (I am a Resident Advisor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective: Display tips, event news, free food notifications provided regularly by RAs and faculty to residents on a website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Say you are an up and coming web developer. You want to make a web app that can access content on other sites. Perhaps you want to make a word cloud from a news article on BBC. Or you want to see what videos a site has embedded within itself. You could achieve that by doing some server side voodoo. The &amp;#8216;standard&amp;#8217; way to go about it would be to download the site to your server and then serve its contents to your webpage.  But that would require two things:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
