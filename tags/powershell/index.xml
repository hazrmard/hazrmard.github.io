Hugo is a static site generator. It takes a bunch of plain text, applies a theme, and renders it as HTML. This is opposed to applications like Wordpress that assemble a page each time its served, to put it simply. This compute once, use many times approach saves on processing time and makes a site more portable.</description></item><item><title>Testing code with sensitive data</title><link>https://iahmed.me/post/2016-09-06-testing-code-with-sensitive-data/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2016 02:01:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iahmed.me/post/2016-09-06-testing-code-with-sensitive-data/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently renewed work on my first ever &lt;a href="https://github.com/hazrmard/imgurPCA">github project&lt;/a>. Over the course of a whole year when that project was dormant, I’d learned some new tricks. I now try to focus on writing tests for my projects. It is immensely convenient when I add features here  and there and need to check the whole code for errors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="">
Anyways, my project requires API keys to imgur.com. However I do not want to hard-code them into my &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://github.com/hazrmard/imgurPCA/blob/master/test.py">test.py&lt;/a>&lt;/em> file. But I also do not want to manually provide keys every time I run tests. So what do I do?</description></item></channel></rss>
