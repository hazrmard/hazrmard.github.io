      <title>Algorithms: Balancing</title>

      <description>Balancing in algorithms refers to minimizing the complexity of an algorithm by making sure that its constituent parts share the load efficiently. It is not a technique for solving problems. Instead it helps us understand how an existing solution may be optimized.
The theory of balancing Say there is a problem of size \(n\). The problem is such that it can be broken down into a sequence of smaller problems.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past year, I have been crunching data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hazrmard/DarkMatterHalos&#34;&gt;dark matter simulations&lt;/a&gt;. Data size can get pretty large when it comes to scientific computing. As I write this post, I have a script running on 3.8 TB (that&amp;#8217;s right &amp;#8211; 3,700 gigabytes) of cosmic particles. At these levels one starts thinking about parallelizing computations. And therein lay my dilemma and a soon to be learned lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Markov Chains – Random Text Generation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This semester I am taking a course in &lt;a href=&#34;http://sc3260s16.github.io/&#34;&gt;High Performance Computing&lt;/a&gt; where I get to work with multi-core systems like computing clusters and graphics cards. For my final project I decided to develop a random text generator and see if I could speed it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A popular method of generating random text (that is grammatically correct) is using &lt;strong&gt;Markov chains&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Talking With Satellites</title>

      <description>This year I am leading a senior design team in developing a software defined radio that can talk with a satellite that Vanderbilt just launched. Compared to a normal radio, an SDR has most of the signal processing functions implemented virtually. This means that it can change its operation on the fly. An interesting application of SDRs is cognitive radio: that is, radios communicating with other radios in their vicinity and adjusting their frequencies to maximize their use of the bandwidth.</description>
