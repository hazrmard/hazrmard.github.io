Hi. My name is Ibrahim. I am a Masters student at Vanderbilt University with a
concentration in Electrical Engineering (EE). I also have a double major in EE and
physics.

I am interested in hardware & software design, machine learning, web & mobile
development, and astrophysics.

Currently my research is on adaptive fault tolerant systems using reinforcement learning. Prior to that, last summer, I was involved with making sense of
terabytes of data from simulations on [Dark Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter).

I like to play tennis, badminton, and video games. Also, In my free time, I read
 fiction, cook (_because no meal plan for grad students :(_), and work on personal
  [projects](/project/).

I aim to contribute to mankind's next leap into exploration of our universe. Coming
up with the Grand Unified Theory would cross another item off my bucket list.
