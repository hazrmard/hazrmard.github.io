[The Four Stellar Equations](/series/the-four-stellar-equations)_

The star is stable. Despite being very massive, it does not collapse under its
own gravity. This means that there is a force within the star that is opposing
the inwards gravitational force. That force is a simple result of Newton's
third law: every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

As gravity pushes inwards, the plasma inside the star is compressed. The deeper
we go inside the star, the greater the pressure becomes since more and more of
the star's mass is pushing down on us. Just like the pressure increases as we
dive deeper into water.
